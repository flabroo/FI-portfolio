cyclee,Full Stack Developer,<p>Le Wagon Project</p>,,"<p>A community-driven bicycle safety app that allows users to rate bicycle lanes, plan routes based on bicycle lanes, and tag bike theft locations.</p>","<p>The inspiration behind this idea was behind one of the team member's personal experience in Toronto where bike theft is common and not dealt with by the government. The general purpose of the web app is to provide a platform that is cyclist-centric and where they can contribute by pinging bicycle parking locations on the app, marking those that has been compromised by thefts and rating bicycle lanes based on their experiences.</p>","<p>This was the 2nd and last project during our time in Le Wagon, so it revolved mainly around Ruby on Rails and stimulus.</p>
<p>The app utilised heavily on <strong>Mapbox</strong> and its vast features as it was the centerpiece of our web app. We explored using layers to provide parking location icons and highlight bicycle lanes so that users will be able to see at a glance after opening the web app. These icons and lanes are colored to provide the users a visual aid to distinguish the good ones from the bad. We also utilised <strong>Mapbox Directions API</strong> to provide instructions to the user based on the bicycle route. <strong>Devise</strong> was also used for user account creation and authentication.</p>","<p>One of the biggest challenges we faced was to implement bicycle lanes in mapbox and making it clickable. Our understanding of mapbox was not comprehensive enough to even know if it was possible to begin with.</p>
<p>After days of researching and learning from other developers' use-cases, we managed to solve this issue by adding a layer in the shape of a line for every lane we have in our database. The color of the line will be updated as it reads the average rating every time the user goes into the homepage. Stimulus is used to make the lanes/icons clickable to open a panel for more information.</p>","[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]",cyclee.png,cyclee
Ramadhan On Wheels,Full Stack Developer,<p>Volunteer Project</p>,,<p>A web application developed for beneficiaries to select and order their goods.</p>,<p>The client wanted to explore tech-savvy ways to reach out to their beneficiaries. The main goal of developing the web application is to allow beneficiaries to select the items they need for their household (with a credit limit) as previously the items were already fixed beforehand. We wanted the app to be straightforward and easy to use as generally the elderly make for most of the beneficiaries and may not be technologically inclined.</p>,"<p>As everyone in the team were graduates from Le Wagon, we decided on Ruby on Rails as our framework as everyone was comfortable with it, thus making tasks interchangeable.</p>
<p>We took this opportunity to explore new features such as <strong>Action Mailer</strong> and learnt more about email servers and <strong>Google Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</strong>. <strong>Forest Admin</strong> was also utilised as a dashboard feature to allow the clients access to the orders created and export it to provide to local supermarkets. It was a good refresher for us on <strong>Stimulus</strong> and how Javascript sends and calls data from Rails controllers, as we need to include a live update on the shopping cart page so that users will know how much credit they are left with.</p>","<p>It was difficult to navigate data around Javascript and Rails, as debugging tools did not help much to identify how the data is being received through the controller in Rails. Thankfully, digging a little deeper into the console and exploring each HTTP request in Google Chrome Developer Tools allowed us to look at the data that is being received.</p>
<p>Overall, it is a straightforward app and the team capitalized on the opportunity to develop and explore new features.</p>","[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]",row.png,row
WhereWorks,Full Stack Developer / Product Owner,<p>Le Wagon Project</p>,,<p>A marketplace app for people to book for hourly working and studying sessions.</p>,"<p>This web app plans to cater to employees or freelancers looking for a place to work or conduct meetings. Being a marketplace app, restaurant owners or library managers will be able to list their locations for booking at their dedicated available timings. Information such as Wi-Fi and shortest route to the location will be available upon confirmed bookings.</p>","<p>This was the first group project in Le Wagon.</p>
<p>The app was straightforward, using <strong>Mapbox</strong> and its functionality to provide a visual aid for the users to locate nearby listings around them. <strong>Simple Form</strong> was also used for the forms for code readability.</p>","<p>This was a straightforward web app but there were a lot of learnings with regards to the UI/UX. As this was our very first web app, a lot of the forms were generated from the data type required and can be a bit messy for the user. For example, the 'Time' field will render the hour, minute and seconds which is detrimental to the user experience. Through this, we have learnt about simplifying forms for the user and converting their input into data that our models will understand.</p>","[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]",whereworks.png,ww
