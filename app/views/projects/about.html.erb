    <h3>I have always loved developing.</h3>

    <p><strong>Looking for my <%= link_to "CV", download_cv_path %>?</strong></p>

    <h3>My quick story</h3>
    <p class="subheader"><strong>My Motivation</strong></p>
    <p>My first real exposure has been through Swoogo. Back in my previous industry, we have always created event or registration websites for clients and managed data on our end. Although it's good enough, it was never great. Website builders are always geared towards efficiency in exchange for its lack of flexibility and customization.</p>

    <p>It has always irked me that I am confined within the limitations of the builder, which brought me towards the “custom HTML, CSS & JS” portion of the builder, and eventually, web development in general. There, I managed to enhance the websites even more according to the clients' needs (even if it's just increasing the font sizes and including pop-out windows, it was still something!) and it dawned on me:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>how easy it was for me to pick up the syntax</li>
      <li>how much more I want to learn about it</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Ever since then, I have graduated from Le Wagon as a Web Developer and have not stopped learning and developing.</p>

    <p class="subheader"><strong>As a developer</strong></p>
    <p>I pride myself in my code's readability, and I can never push my changes without organizing it first. As someone who has developed 3 web applications in a team, having code that is not understandable and refactored too much will not just hinder your teammates but yourself too.</p>

    <p>I will not hesitate to share my thought processes whenever I find solutions to roadblocks that the team might face. I have always believed that sharing knowledge is also a form of learning.</p>

    <p>I am interested to work on new projects as there are always new learnings that I can take from them. I will always find time to meet fellow developers to hear about their ideas and provide my perspectives.</p>

    <p class="subheader"><strong>As a colleague</strong></p>

    <p>I am always described as an individual that knows how to work and have fun. I am usually deemed as the happy pill but always serious during crunch time. With my background in events management, I am able to discern the client's needs and their long term goals.</p>

    <p>I feel comfortable interacting with stakeholders, from colleagues to clients as my communication skills are excellent. I take pride in my current stint as a Teacher Assistant in Le Wagon, where I was given the opportunity after graduating due to my approachable demeanor and the way I explain the concepts of web development to my peers.</p>

    <p class="subheader"><strong>As a person</strong></p>

    <p>I pride myself in my resourcefulness. I am always approached for perspectives and advice, during and out of office hours. I am curious by nature and passionate about the things I like, and that involves cycling, gymming and of course, web development.</p>
